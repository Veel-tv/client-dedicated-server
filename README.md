## How to run
Recommended to use Nw.js. However, you can run this in Node.js directly as well.

- Firstly, clone this repository locally on your device.
- Run Npm install to install the prerequisite modules.

### Nw.js way
1. Download the latest Nw.js from [the official Nw.js site](https://nwjs.io/).
2. Either copy all the Nw.js files into the root of where you downloaded/cloned this repository to and run the executable "Nw". Or run the "Nw" executable from terminal and make the first argument the location you downloaded/cloned this repository.
 
### Node.js way
1. Open terminal or CMD and go to the directory you downloaded/cloned this repository.
2. Run Node and make the first argument be js/main.js. Or change "main" from "index.html" to "js/main.js" and run Node without arguments or just the main directory as the first argument.
